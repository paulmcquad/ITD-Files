## Subject Status: Mandatory X Elective

## Credit Level: 1 Credit Number: 5

## Pre-requisite Subjects: N/A Co-requisite Subjects: N/A


### Subject Aims:

This subject aims to provide an introduction to the use of semiconductor devices in electronic circuits. The subject is also
used to reinforce a basic understanding of circuit theory analysis in combination with other relevant subjects. The
student is familiarized with a range of semiconductor components and the relevant measurement techniques involved in
constructing and testing simple analogue circuits. Elements of analytical techniques are explored when dealing with the
circuits.

### Learning Outcomes:

|  | On successful completion of this module the learner will be able to: |
|---|:---:|
| LO1 | Compare and contrast conductors, semiconductors and insulators and describe and analyse electrical conduction in semiconductor devices and the DC characteristics of the semiconductor diode and the Bipolar Junction Transistor |
| LO2 | Describe and analyse transistor load-line and DC biasing schemes and model the small-signal-AC operation of the BJT in Common Emitter and Common Collector amplifiers. |
| LO3 | Describe and analyse the general model for a voltage amplifier incorporating source, load, input and output resistances and basic Operational Amplifier circuits. |
| LO4 | Explain and analyse the AC operation of the diode in basic linear rectifier circuits. |
| LO5 | Be able to use scientific notation, engineering notation, metric prefixes and metric unit conversions. |
| LO6 | Construct electronic circuits, perform DC and AC measurements and record (in Lab notebook). Write a formal technical lab report. |
